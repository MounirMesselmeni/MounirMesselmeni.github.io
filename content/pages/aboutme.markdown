Title: About me


<img src="{filename}/images/mounir_profile_photo.jpg" width="150" alt="Mounir Messelmeni photo">

My name is Mounir Messelmeni, I'm a Senior Python/Django Developer from Tunisia and 
living currently in Stuttgart Germany where I moved there since February 2015.

I have been using Python and Django since 2013, and I must admit that I love what I'm currently doing using
this awesome toocv_mounir_messelmeni.pdfls, I attended DjangoCon Europe 2015 in Cardiff which was a very cool experience for me, specially
knowing the community, discussing and seeing many Django contributors ...

I also have been a very small Django contributor with [some small patches/fixes][1], I still don't find a lot find time
to do more but I try my best.

I'm trying to post in this blog all the best I can, I believe that the quality of writing and content could be better,
but I try every month to find some time on my spare time to write some useful stuff I encountered.
And I really know that I'm writing lesser than 10% of what I'm solving on daily basis, but still 5% is better than 0.

You can reach me for any question/suggestion by email <mailto:messelmeni.mounir@gmail.com>

For my full experience and details you can see my [CV/Resume][2].
